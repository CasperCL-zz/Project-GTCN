Previous versions
______________________
======================
The PlayPillow GUI 2.7

Features:
+ Improvements on uploading files;
+ Added classes Menu and Submenu;
+ More inheritance;
+ Classes divided into packages.
+ New UML Structure


Removed:
- Window.java is now included in the Menu.java and therefore no longer necessary.

So what's new?
I added the Superclass Menu.java, which extends JFrame, and its subclass SubMenu.java
Menu is the superclass of the MainMenu and SubMenu has the submenu's as descendents.
This simplifies the concept of uploading files because less code is necessary.

Version 2.7 simplifies this:
<SubMenuClass> -> COMSelector -> HEXUploader
(NOTE: <SubMenuClass> can be a class of any type that is a descendent of the SubMenu class.)
It seemed more logical to use SubMenu a class than as an interface because it needs to hold
specific values that are from its descendents. And because it needs to DO something for its
descendents.



======================
The PlayPillow GUI 2.6

Features:
+ Improvements on uploading files
+ COMSelector now has a refresh button for the ports
+ Improvements on Window.java; setting the screen is made easier now

Problems detected 2.6:
- The argument(to upload) -bxxxxxxxx, where x is a number, seems to change so now and then.
  This is bad because the argument needs to be static.
Possible Solutions:
~ Autodetect on what -bxxxxxxxx the x values are.


EXPLAINED
Version 2.6 of The PlayPillow GUI comes with great improvements.
The uploading is done by one central class: the HEXUploader.java.
This simplifies the previous concept where every JFrame had its own
way of uploading.

Uploading previous versions (2.3 - 2.5):
SubMenuModeSelection.java - > COMSelector.java -> SubMenuModeSelection.java
SubMenuSound.java- > COMSelector.java -> SubMenuSound.java

Version 2.6 simplifies this:
<SubMenuClass> -> COMSelector -> HEXUploader
(NOTE: <SubMenuClass> can be a class of any type that implements the SubMenu Interface.)

Via a reference of the SubMenu interface, the COMSelector is able to control the methods
that are necessary for uploading the files.
There are some considerations in which the SubMenu Interface needs to grown to a superclass
of the classes SubMenuModeSelection.java and SubMenuSound.java. This might be featured in
verion 2.7 of The PlayPillow GUI.


The PlayPillow GUI 2.5
======================
Big upgrades leading up to the development of v2.6, as v2.5 is just a backup plan on v2.6 
with less features than its successor. 
Features
+ Name changes in the directories


======================
The PlayPillow GUI 2.4
This version of the PlayPillow is now under the hood fully functional ^_^, only some names 
in the Difficulty submenu and folders(directories) should be changed. Also the submenu Sound 
should be ready for an erase!

Long story short; this version features:
+ A new background
+ A fixed location on the screen on startup
+ No longer resizable JFrames
+ Some feedback with JOptionPanes for the user when errors occur


Happy reading
Casper :)

The PlayPillow GUI 2.3 and lower had problems with uploading which are fixed in 2.4+
v2.3 and lower are not documented.
